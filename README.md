# Morse-Code-Generator-and-Decoder-GUI-in-MATLAB
MATLAB GUI for Morse code generation and decoding. Users can input messages (up to 10 letters) to generate Morse code, view its representation, and save it as a .wav file. The GUI also decodes uploaded Morse code audio files, converting them back to text for easy interpretation.
