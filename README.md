# Morse-Code-Generator-and-Decoder-GUI-in-MATLAB
MATLAB GUI for Morse code generation and decoding. Users can input messages (up to 10 letters) to generate Morse code, view its representation, and save it as a .wav file. The GUI also decodes uploaded Morse code audio files, converting them back to text for easy interpretation.

The Morse_Code.mlx file contains all the necessary functions and analysis of a sound file of morse code to convert it back to text
